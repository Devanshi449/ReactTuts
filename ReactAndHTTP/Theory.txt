how react works with https

when we are creating a web application more often we have to react out to the server to fetch some data or send some data based on user interaction

This application is react application
But earlier we have know that react is a library for building user interfaces and it is in no way concerned about http

this raises avery serious question
how do we make ajax requests or api callss in react.

react does not have any particular way to fetch or send data to the server in fact as far as react is concerned
it dosen't veen have to know that there is a server in the picture as react simply read props and state and render the ui therefore to use some data from the server you just have to get the data 
into components props or state.

now if react is not handling the requests who will be doing that?
we have to make use of any http library, we will use axios 

tut2)
we will make use of json placeholder to fetch the data
