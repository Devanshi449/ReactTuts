useReducer is a hook that is used for state management 

wait...don't we already have useState for state management.
...useReducer is an alternative to useState

what's the difference?
useState is build using useReducer
so useReducer is a more primitive hook compared to useState

when both are made for managing state when to use useReducer vs useState!!!!!
but at first video we can't understand this 

useState- related to state
useEffect- related to side effects
useContext-ContextAPI
useReducer-reducers

in javascript- arr.reduce() fucntion takes 2 parameters,one is reducer fucntion , second, accumulator (or the initial value that the reducer fucntion can make use of the  )

so there is a hige similarity btw the reduce and useReducer
--------------------------DIFFERENCE-------------------------------------
reduce in javascript                         useReducer in React

array.reduce(reducer,initialValues)          useReducer(reducer,initialState)

in it's simplest form it will accept         it returns new state
                                             newState=reducer(currentstate,action)
2 values accumulator and item value and 
return a single value
singleValue=reducer(accumulator,itemValue)   

reduce method returns a single value         useReducer returns a pair of values.
                                             [newState,dispatch]
