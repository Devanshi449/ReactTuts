what are hooks? 

hooks are a new feature addition in react version 16.8 which allow you to use react features without having to write a class
ex; for state of a component we can use useState only within class but now it is possible to use state and props without writing class

hooks don't work inside classes;

WHY HOOKS ? ***********
reason set 1---
understand how this keyword works in javascript
remerber to bind event handlers in class components.
classes don't minify very well and make hot teloading very unreliable
but with hooks you don't have to face these problemss

reason set 2----

there is no particular way to reuse stateful component logic
but HOC and render props patterns do address this problemss
but this makes code harder to follow
so There is a need to share stateful logics in a better way

reason set 3
create components for complex scenarios such as data fetching and subscribing to events
is difficult because related code is not organised in one place
ex-data fetching - in componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate
ex event listeners-in ComponentDidMount and componentWillUnmount
Bacause of stateful logic-cannot break components into smaller organised

Noteworthy points
react version 16.8 or higher
completely opt in
hooks don't contain any breaking changes and the release is 100% backwards-compatible
classes won't be removed from react
can't use hooks inside of a class component
hooks don't replace you existing knowledge of react components 
instead, hooks provide a more direct API to the react components you already know

-->Only call hooks at the top level
Don't call hooks inside loops,condition or nested function

-->only call hooks from react fucntions
call them from within react fucntions and not just any regular javacsript fucntion
